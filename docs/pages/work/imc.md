[IMC](https://www.imc.com/us/) is a high-frequency algorithmic trading firm focused on market making. During my internship there, I built a trade analysis tool, Missed Quote Product (MQT), to identify reasons for missing thousands of profitable trades daily. Using distributed data processing tools (JavaSpark & Hadoop), MQT processed terabytes of trade data in minutes.

At the end of the summer, I received a full-time offer. Even though I had a great experience working at IMC, I ultimately turned the offer down to pursue my second startup, Strata Labs.
