[Ripple](https://ripple.com/) is a leading financial services provider in the blockchain space. They are known for the XRP Ledger, which supports sending very fast and low-cost payments. The ledgerâ€™s token, XRP, is a [top 10 market cap crypto token](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/xrp).

After I joined Ripple, I worked as a lead engineer building the PayString Protocol and its [reference implementation](https://github.com/PayString/paystring). PayString is a human-readable identifier for crypto wallets that is compatible with any blockchain. The protocol was adopted by over 20 institutions, including [Blockchain.com](https://www.blockchain.com/wallet), [Crypto.com](https://help.crypto.com/en/articles/4424992-paystring-how-does-it-work), [Bitpay](https://bitpay.com/), and many others.
