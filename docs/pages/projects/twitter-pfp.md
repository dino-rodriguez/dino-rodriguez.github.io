In 2021, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) gained significant attention in the blockchain space. To leverage this trend, X (formerly Twitter) introduced a feature in their paid tier that allowed users to set an Ethereum NFT they owned as their profile picture, with ownership verifiable by others on the platform.

I developed the backend for a free alternative to this feature. This tool supported uploading NFTs across multiple blockchains. By linking a Twitter account and using a cryptographic signature, users could verify ownership of a token, allowing them to set it as their profile picture. A public page also displayed token details, letting others confirm the ownership and authenticity of the NFT.
