During the summer of 2015 I worked for Harvard in two main roles. The first was as a software engineering intern for [CS50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CS50), where I built an app on the Amazon FireTV to stream all of the class videos and lectures to students. 

CS50 is Harvard’s primary introductory course on computer science. It is Harvard’s largest class and it’s online version, [CS50x](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science), is one of the most popular online courses in the world, with over 6 million students enrolled as of fall 2024.

My second role was as a teaching fellow for an iOS development course, where I taught a class of around 20 students to build apps in Swift, guiding them in creating their own full apps by the end of the term.

This was also the summer that I began developing [the Wolfe](https://thewolfe.io/).
