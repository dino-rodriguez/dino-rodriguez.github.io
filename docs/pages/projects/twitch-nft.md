Twitch is a platform where users can livestream to audiences in real time. It’s common for Twitch streamers to offer rewards or incentives to engage their viewers.

As NFTs gained mainstream attention in 2021 I developed the backend of a tool that enabled Twitch streamers to reward viewer engagement with non-fungible tokens (NFTs). During a livestream an overlay would prompt viewers to claim their reward which would trigger the creation of an NFT when clicked. The NFT was then stored in a pre-created blockchain wallet associated with the viewer’s Twitch account.
