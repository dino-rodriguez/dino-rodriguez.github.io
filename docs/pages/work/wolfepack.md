As Founder & CEO of Wolfepack, my goal was to create an external GPU with the power of a desktop GPU for laptops, specifically Macs. After raising funding from [Rough Draft Ventures](https://www.generalcatalyst.com/perspectives/apply-to-join-rough-draft-ventures-powered-by-general-catalyst) (General Catalyst) in 2015, we designed and built [the Wolfe](https://thewolfe.io/) — an external graphics card using a consumer level GPU, specialized PCIe hardware, and a custom built enclosure. It delivered 5-10x the performance of the integrated GPUs in top-tier MacBooks at the time.

In the summer of 2015 I wrote and filed a pending patent, and we launched [a Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thewolfe/the-wolfe-supercharge-your-laptop) for the Wolfe. The target was $50k and we raised over $300k in the first week with 800+ backers. However, we canceled the campaign due to contractual and legal constraints with our manufacturer’s obligations to Apple.

In 2017 we were accepted into [Y-combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/),  but due to the ongoing legal difficulties that made it prohibitive to move forward as we intended, we chose not to proceed. Even so, the experience was invaluable. It taught me many things, including how to:

- Go from idea to fully realized product in a short timeline
- Test for product market fit with limited resources
- Effectively pitch, raise capital and sell & market a product
