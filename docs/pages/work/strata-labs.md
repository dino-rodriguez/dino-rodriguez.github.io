As Founder and CTO at Strata Labs, I focused on building and managing distributed, fault-tolerant cloud infrastructure to process payments using the Interledger Network. The network is built on the [Interledger Protocol](https://interledger.org/developers/get-started/), an open protocol for sending payments across different currencies or payment networks.

After raising funding from [General Catalyst](https://www.generalcatalyst.com/), [Chris Larsen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Larsen), and others, we developed the infrastructure and onboarded multiple financial institutions. Strata Labs became one of the largest payment processors on the Interledger Network, handling over 10 billion payments. 

In 2019 we accepted an offer from [Ripple](https://ripple.com/) to [acquire Strata Labs](https://www.crunchbase.com/acquisition/xpring-acquires-strata-labs--b37956f7).
