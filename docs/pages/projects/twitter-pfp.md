In 2021 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) gained significant attention in the blockchain space. To leverage this trend Twitter introduced a feature in their paid tier that allowed users to set an Ethereum NFT they owned as their profile picture. Ownership details were visible to others on the platform.

I developed the backend for a free alternative to this feature which supported uploading NFTs across multiple blockchains, not just Ethereum. By linking a user's Twitter account and having them generate a cryptographic signature, we verified that a user owned the NFT and allowed them to set it as their profile picture. A public page also displayed token details, allowing others to confirm the ownership and authenticity of the NFT.
