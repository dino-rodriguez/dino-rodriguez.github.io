As Founder & CEO of Wolfepack my goal was to create an external GPU (eGPU) for laptops, specifically Macs. After raising funding from [Rough Draft Ventures](https://www.generalcatalyst.com/perspectives/apply-to-join-rough-draft-ventures-powered-by-general-catalyst) (General Catalyst) we designed and built [the Wolfe](https://thewolfe.io/) — an eGPU built from a desktop GPU, specialized PCIe hardware, and a custom built enclosure. It delivered 5-10x more performance than the integrated GPUs in top-tier MacBooks at the time.

In the summer of 2016 I wrote and filed a pending patent for the technology and we launched [a Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thewolfe/the-wolfe-supercharge-your-laptop) for the Wolfe. We raised over 600% of our funding goal in the first week with 800+ backers. However, we canceled the campaign due to contractual and legal constraints from our manufacturer’s obligations to Apple.

In 2017 we were accepted into [Y-combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) and invited to the [Thiel Fellowship Summit](https://thielfellowship.org/). My experience at Wolfepack was invaluable and taught me many things, some of which included:

- How to go from idea to fully realized product in a short timeline
- How to test for product market fit with limited resources
- How to effectively pitch, raise capital and sell & market a product
