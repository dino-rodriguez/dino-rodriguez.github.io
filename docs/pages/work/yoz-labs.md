During my time at Yoz Labs as a founding software engineer, I led backend development. Some of my main contributions included:
- Architecting and building the backend for a real-time blockchain notifications product that sent tens of thousands of notifications across 6+ blockchains.
- Developing and deploying blockchain smart contracts used by thousands of users.
- Building and deploying the companyâ€™s distributed cloud infrastructure to run all of our products and services on AWS and GCP.
